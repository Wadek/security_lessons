## Introduction
The intent of these lessons are to expand on the fun learning process of becoming more knowledgable about IT Security Concerns. This means making use of the excellent resource written by [https://www.stationx.net/nathan-house/](Nathan House) and then applying them from the perspective of an IT professional. In my humble opinion, any IT professional (including executives), can benefit from this knoweldge base.

## Tools

### Vim
Tools used are always first considered from the perspective of a terminal.  If I am writing any code, updating any document, or interacting with any file, I will always first try to use vim. The reason for this is because in the evergrowing, ever more complex world of IT, having the simplicity of a super powerful tool which enables you to do nearly eveverything, gives you a significant edge over your peers.

### Logbook
From day one (which means starting today, coming from whichever perspective you are coming from), start writing a logbook. It is a good habit to get into. I write my logbook as part of my daily work.  When i conceive of a task, or am grabbing another task I have not written, from the work backlog, I immediately write it in my logbook. 
	- A running narrative of what I have worked on throughout the day, as I work on it.
	- Apply some basic analysis to my work day efficiency.  Any time I fall out of the habit of writing in my logbook, my efficiency drop is noticeable.
	- Efficiently share with your team on daily standups.
	- Maintain an accurate record of what you have worked on, as you are adding to it in real time.

### byobu
This script is the bees knees. One can accomplish everything, including world peace, when becoming a byobu power user.  Take the time to learn how to use byobu, or emacs, spacemacs or somthing similar. 

## Set-up 
It is a good idea to set up your own repo and go through the learning process of the course, or follow along with this repo.  It is important to apply what you are learning so as to increase your learning footprint. To maximize your learning, write your README in a linux terminal, and format the file using [https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](format syntax). You will gain exposure to how HTML formats text in a file for rendering on a webpage.

## Best-Practices, Merging 
No matter what you do for work, in an IT business, it is imperative that you know how to properly merge your code. Whether you are an exectutive writing up a document which explains new policies being implemented, or you are a Junior IT developer merging your first chunk of code
## Principles 
#### It is important to retain these principles as you go through the course.

**Thought Experiment**
These are questions you can ask to discover what is worth securing.  Try to think from the perspective in which you are striving to apply Security in.  If you are approaching this from the perspective of starting a career in cyber security, then think about in terms of your single machine.
